ERROR CODE
MESSAGE
* DESCRIPTION
* USER RESPONSE

==== LEVELS TABLE

LG0L1
LEVEL_ID should be equal or greater than zero.
* When inserting into the LEVELS table, any LEVEL_ID provided should be greater
or equal to zero.
* Reissue the insert statement with a LEVEL_ID greater than zero.

LG0L2
LEVEL_ID should be consecutive to the previous maximal value.
* When inserting into the LEVELS table, it is not possible to have gaps in the
LEVEL_ID values.
* Check the current maximal value in the LEVELS table, and try a LEVEL_ID with
a value of MAX + 1.

LG0L3
It is not possible to change the LEVEL_ID.
* Once a LEVEL_ID has been inserted in a LEVELS row, it cannot be modified.
There could be references to this value in other tables (for example LOGS)
without enforcing the referential integrity. If this value is modified, it will
appear incoherences. At the same time, it is not possible assign a new value
without creating gaps in the table.
* Delete values and re-insert, to adapt the structure to your
requirements.

LG0L4
Trying to delete the minimal value.
* The operation is trying to delete the minimal value which is 0, and this is
not allowed because there must be at least a defined level in the LEVELS table.
* Delete other values, but not the minimal one.

LG0L5
The only possible LEVEL_ID to delete is the maximal value.
* The issued statement is trying to delete a LEVEL_ID different to the
maximal in the LEVELS table. It is prohibit, because this will create gaps in
the list of LEVELS.
* You must delete levels by deleting the maximal LEVEL_ID value.

==== CONF_LOGGERS TABLE

LG0C1
The only logger without parent is ROOT.
* All loggers should have a parent. The only one that do not have ascendency is
ROOT.
* Assign a parent to the provided logger. Probably, its parent will be ROOT (0).

LG0C2
It is not possible to update any value in this table (only LEVEL_ID is 
possible).
* Once a logger has been created, most of its properties cannot be changed. The
LOGGER_ID helps to uniquely identify it. NAME is a unique value in the
hierarchy. PARENT_ID indicates its ancestry.
* Do not try to modify the values of a logger. If a logger was mis-defined,
create a new one (new LOGGER_ID, correct NAME, probably same PARENT_ID).

LG0C3
There could be only one ROOT logger
* Trying to insert a second ROOT logger with values (ID = 0, PARENT = NULL),
however it already exists in the table.
* This operation is not permitted, insert other levels different to ROOT.

==== CONF_LOGGERS_EFFECTIVE TABLE

LG0E1
The only logger without parent is ROOT.
* All loggers should have a parent. The only one that do not have ascendency is
ROOT. Remember that this table is managed by the application, this means that
the users do not have to modify it directly.
* Assign a parent to the provided logger. Probably, its parent will be ROOT (0).

LG0E2
It is not possible to update any value in this table (only LEVEL_ID is 
possible).
* Once a logger has been created, most of its properties cannot be changed. The
LOGGER_ID helps to uniquely identify it. NAME is a unique value in the
hierarchy. PARENT_ID indicates its ancestry. Remember that this table is managed
by the application, this means that the users do not have to modify it directly.
* Do not try to modify the values of a logger. If a logger was mis-defined,
create a new one (new LOGGER_ID, correct NAME, probably same PARENT_ID).

LG0E3
It is not possible to update the LEVEL_ID manually.
* The LEVEL_ID is updated when the associated configuration in the CONF_LOGGERS
table is modified. However, this value cannot be modified manually, and it
should match the established value in the configuration table.
* Update the LEVEL_ID to the same level defined in the CONF_LOGGERS table.

LG0E4
ROOT logger cannot be deleted.
* There should always exist the ROOT logger in the CONF_LOGGERS_EFFECTIVE table.
It cannot be deleted, because this is the origin of the ancestry for any level.
* If you are deleting in bulk (DELETE FROM CONF_LOGGERS_EFEFCTIVE) put a
condition to not delete ROOT logger.

LG0E5
Inserting a duplicate logger.
* It already exists a logger with the same name in the same position of the
hierarchy (same PARENT_ID).
* Use the existing LOGGER_ID or change the name for the logger in the same
level of the hierarchy. You can also change the PARENT_ID, but that changes the
logger in the hierarchy with other ascendency/descendency.

==== CONF_APPENDERS TABLE

LG0A1
APPENDER_ID for appenders should be greater or equal to zero.
* Any APPENDER_ID should be greater or equal to zero, and the statement is
issuing a negative value.
* Reissue the statement with a positive or zero value.
