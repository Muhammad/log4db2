         CALL LOG_JAVA(LOG_ID, LEV_ID, NEW_MESSAGE, CONFIGURATION);

 * Insert your appender in the list of appenders.

    INSERT INTO APPENDERS (APPENDER_ID, NAME)
      VALUES (3, 'UTL_FILE');

 * Install the appenders from file:

    cd sql-pl
    db2 -tsf Appenders_No_ExpC.sql

 * Add your own configuration or update the existing one.
