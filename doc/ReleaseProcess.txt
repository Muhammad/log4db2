This is the procedure to do for each release.

There are three sections:

* BEFORE: To prepare the release.
* PERFORM: Tasks that conform the release.
* AFTER: Once the release has been done, some extra tasks to prepare the env.

BEFORE

* To change the version variable in the code (AdminHeader):
https://github.com/angoca/log4db2/blob/master/src/main/sql-pl/AdminHeader.sql
* Make sure the schema reflects the version number to release (all files.)

PERFORM

* To create a directory in SourceForge with the version to release as name.
* To execute mvn.
* To publish the generated files in the target directory, into the just created directory in SourceForge.

AFTER

* To change the schema name to the new version is all files.
* Test that there are not references to the previous release.
